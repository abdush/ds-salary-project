Backed by impressive funding, we're poised to re-engineer a trillion-dollar category, and that’s just the beginning. We’re using rich customer insights, advanced technology and data science to build our cloud-native InsurTech solution, and other things we haven’t even dreamt up yet. We're out to change behavior and promote mindful living at a societal level. But the key to us being successful in our mission isn’t just about nailing the technology—it’s about hiring the talented people who can help us make a quantifiable impact in the world. We’re growing our world-class team. And that’s where you come in.

For example, you should know how to deal with clustering and should be able to determine the standard errors of different statistics through simulation.
Multi-armed bandit models: You know how to implement the technique and how to write a good cost function.
Modern techniques: You can build a model that powers an app that serves a unique arrangement of diverse components to each user such that the specific components served were chosen to maximize the specific user’s probability of selecting a call to action (i.e. using machine learning to identify complex heterogenous treatment effects).
War stories: You must be able to talk about times you ran experiments in a complex environment and what you learned from the effort
Specific experience in marketing optimization is a plus.

Why this job?

1. Work on a product people love that solves real problems: Your friends and family can use Notion to take notes, display photos, collect recipes — while Fortune 500 companies use it to run huge teams (and some non-profits use it to conserve wildlife).
2. Help define what data means at Notion: As the first hire working full-time on data at Notion, you'll have outsized influence on what data infrastructure, data analysis, and data team structure look like as we grow the business.
3. Join us at a magical time: We've hit profitability and product-market fit, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow.
So, what will you do as a Data Scientist at Notion?
You'll build models to predict things like conversion and likelihood of churn.
You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions.
You'll collaborate with team leads across the business to understand and support their data needs.
You'll build and improve our underlying data infrastructure and tooling. (We currently use DBT, Snowflake, Mode Analytics, Fivetran, Census, Amplitude, Segment, and more).
You might be a fit for this role if...
You've spent meaningful time as a senior data scientist — or even better, you've previously managed a team (there's opportunity to do that here).
You have experience building predictive statistical and machine learning models, and you can build reproducible backtests for proposed models to demonstrate their effectiveness.
You have experience building out data infrastructure which facilitates speed, reliability, and scalability.
You are a SQL expert. You have no problem regularly leveraging window functions, UDFs, self-joins, and other complex SQL functions to accomplish your data analysis goals.

Hungryroot is an online grocery service that delivers modern, healthy food with recipe and meal planning support. Hungryroot's mission is to help people feel their best by making it easier to shop for, cook, and love healthy food. In addition to offering a curated selection of modern brands, Hungryroot develops its own in-house line of innovative healthy products—like Black Bean Brownie Batter—and is challenging the traditional CPG model by building a customer-driven innovation platform to push outdated American grocery offerings into the 21st century.

About the opportunity

We're hiring a Data Scientist, Personalization to advance the ways that Hungryroot delivers personalized groceries and recipes to customers every week.

Hungryroot is an online grocery service that delivers modern, healthy food with recipe and meal planning support. Hungryroot's mission is to help people feel their best by making it easier to shop for, cook, and love healthy food. In addition to offering a curated selection of modern brands, Hungryroot develops its own in-house line of innovative healthy products—like Black Bean Brownie Batter—and is challenging the traditional CPG model by building a customer-driven innovation platform to push outdated American grocery offerings into the 21st century.

About the opportunity

We're hiring a Data Scientist, Personalization to advance the ways that Hungryroot delivers personalized groceries and recipes to customers every week.

Today Hungryroot sends hundreds of thousands of groceries each week to customers across the country, each with their own flavor preferences, dietary restrictions, and food occasion needs. Our algorithm takes in all of these signals and balances them against our inventory of delicious, perishable food products and customers' love for variety in what they eat.

We learn about each customer's taste via explicit signals like their preference for how often they receive an individual item and their star ratings of recipes, as well as implicit signals like their retention and weekly spend. There are big opportunities for advancing the algorithm, including identifying other predictive implicit signals via regressions, collecting new explicit signals from customers, leveraging collaborative filtering, and more.

This role will own personalization end-to-end. We'll look to you to recommend ways of optimizing our algorithm against a goal of customer satisfaction and retention. You'll be responsible for prioritizing research and analyses into what opportunities exist, working with Engineering to test hypotheses, and collaborating with Product, UX Research, and Design when we want to learn from or surface things to our customers.

You'll be joining a team that reports to the VP Product and includes a Product Manager, a Product Designer, a UX Researcher, and a Business Analyst. We all fit within Hungryroot's overall crew of 40 motivated, smart and kind teammates.
